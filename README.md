## Usage

### 1. Submitting a Resignation
Employees can create a new resignation request via the Resignation menu. The request includes details such as the reason for resignation and the expected last day.

### 2. Approval Process
- The request is first submitted for review.
- It requires approval from the employee's manager and the HR department.
- Approvals can be managed via the standard Odoo approvals app integration or the custom workflow buttons.

### 3. Clearance Process
Once the resignation is approved:
- A clearance record is generated.
- Relevant departments are notified to complete their specific clearance checklists (e.g., collecting laptops, settling accounts).
- The final clearance status is updated once all checklists are completed.
